# Conic-Optimisation-Tutorial
This purpose of this tutorial is to introduce readers to a "subsidiary" of problem-solving software, more specifically the branch therein that focuses on linear algebra for optimisation problems. While linear optimisation techniques are specialised, and require a considerate amount of preface in order to be formally taught at a tertiary level, this tutorial will overlook certain fundamental aspects to demonstrate the purpose that the software lends to conventional problems. In doing so, it will ensure that by the end of this tutorial, readers will be confident in "beginner-level" usage of the software.
